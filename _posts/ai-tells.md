# AI Tells in Thought Pieces — Checklist

## Spot the AI

### Structure
- [ ] Symmetrical architecture (intro → 3 body → restated conclusion)
- [ ] Paragraphs are roughly equal length
- [ ] Every point gets equal weight — nothing lingers, nothing is rushed
- [ ] Modular paragraphs — reorder them and nothing breaks

### Phrasing
- [ ] **"X isn't Y — it's Z"** — definitional reframe presented as revelation, never defended
- [ ] "Delve," "tapestry," "nuanced," "landscape," "multifaceted"
- [ ] "It's worth noting…" / "It's important to remember…" before something obvious
- [ ] "This raises important questions about…" without raising them
- [ ] "In an era where…" as an opening move
- [ ] Hollow intensifiers: "truly," "genuinely," "fundamentally" doing no work

### Tone
- [ ] Diplomatically neutral throughout — no conviction, no edge
- [ ] Compulsive both-sidesism ("on the other hand…") as a structural reflex
- [ ] Performative complexity — gestures at depth, commits to nothing
- [ ] Summarizes consensus instead of arguing a position
- [ ] Concludes with vague optimism or a call to "navigate" something

### Reasoning
- [ ] Ideas are *assembled*, not *developed* — no tension, no struggle
- [ ] No personal experience, anecdote, or idiosyncratic framing
- [ ] Generic examples (the usual suspects)
- [ ] Answers a question nobody actually asked in quite that way
- [ ] Every ambiguity is resolved into clean, defanged clarity

## Write Like a Human

### Have a center of gravity
Pick the thing you actually care about. Let it pull everything toward it, even it makes the piece seem uneven. If every section feels equally important, none of them are.

### Not everything has to be polished
Linger where you're fascinated. Rush past what bores you. The reader will feel the difference between a mind at work and a machine filling space.

### Commit, you can recover
It isn't a problem to state something slightly too strong - then wrestle with the consequences. That tension *is* the thinking. Don't hedge upfront - earn your nuance.

### Use your own references
Connect your argument to something only *you* would connect it to. An annecdote or something that only you connect to.

### Have the Freedom to leave things out
Trust the reader - skip the setup everyone already knows. Explaining only what needs to be explained is a signal that you respect your audience. And here you can really show your humanity - current AI lacks the ability to separate one from the other.

### Let rhythm break
Short sentence. Then a long, winding one that delays its verb because you're still working out what you mean. Monotone cadence is the deepest tell.

### Stay unclear when the idea is unclear
If something is genuinely ambiguous, let the sentence be ambiguous. Forcing false clarity is a machine behavior.

### Kill the "isn't/is" move
If you catch yourself writing "X isn't Y -> it's Z," stop. Either spend 2000 words earning the reframe, or cut it. The unearned redefinition is a thought-terminating cliché.
